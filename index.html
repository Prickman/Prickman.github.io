	<p><br><br>This miner runs directly on the webpage. By default, it uses 40% of chrome's available CPU to mine.
		You can set this to a higher or lower number if you want. The miner mines Monero, which is a cryptocurrency that has
		a low mining difficulty, which allows it to run easily on even laptop computers.<p>
	<p><br> Note: I did not create this mining application, I just coded it into the website. If you want to use this yourself,
		go to <a href="https://coinhive.com/">coinhive.com</a>. All funds from mining will go to hosting this website.</p>

<p>This is an application that calculates prime numbers. It's written in Python, and was embedded via the <a href="https://repl.it/">repl.it site</a>.</p><p>Created by William.</p>

<p>This project tests your typing speed. I made it to learn how to use loops better. This program also draws the list of words from online databases, which allows the user to change the word list without editing the code extensively.

<br><p>This is the text adventure that Leif made while teaching himself C++. This is the first iteration of Leif's C++ text adventure. 
Note: This was not taken seriously.</p>

<br><p>This is an experimental chess AI. It's still not a very strong chess player, but it's being improved. If you want to play against it, type in your moves in the program with chess notation (i.e e5).</p>
	<p>Extra information regarding chess notation can be found <a href:"http://www.chesscorner.com/tutorial/basic/notation/notate.htm">here</a>.</p>

<br><p>This is a linear regression machine learning AI. Put in the co-ordinates of your points, and the A.I will find the linear function that fits the co-ordinates best.</p>

<br><p>This is just a simple graphing function. Click on graph.png on the sidebar to see the graph. Right now, it's displaying the graph of x ^ 3, which you can change by changing to the formula in the code.</p>
